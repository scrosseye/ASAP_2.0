# ASAP_2.0

The ASAP 2.0 corpus comprises 24,278 persuasive essays taken from standardized writing tests collected at the state level from 6th, 8th, 9th, and 10th grade students. All essays were sourced-based, requiring students to read and integrate source information into their responses. There were seven prompts in total. Of the ~25,000 essays, 12,871 essays were sourced from the PERSUADE 2.0 corpus (Crossley et al, 2024) and 11,829 of the essays have never been released . Essays were selected to maximize the amount of demographic information available for each writer including English Language Learning (ELL) status, economic background (disadvantaged or not), disability status, race/ethnicity, gender, and grade level. However, 4,005 essays from the PERSUADE 2.0 corpus did not include information about economic or disability status. An additional 41 essays in the PERSUADE 2.0 corpus did not include ELL status. Of the new essays, 309 did not include ELL status and five did not include race/ethnicity information.
